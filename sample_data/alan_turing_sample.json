  "title": "Alan Turing",
  "summary": "Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.",
